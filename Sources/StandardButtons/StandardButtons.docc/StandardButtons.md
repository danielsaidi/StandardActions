# ``StandardButtons``

StandardButtons is a SwiftUI library that makes it easy to create standard button types.


## Overview

![Library logotype](Logo.png)

StandardButtons is a SwiftUI library that lets you create standard button types, with localized titles, icons, roles and keyboard shortcuts.

StandardButtons defines **110+** standard button types, like ``StandardButtonType/add``, ``StandardButtonType/delete``, ``StandardButtonType/edit``, ``StandardButtonType/done``, etc. Each button type has a localized ``StandardButtonType/title``, an ``StandardButtonType/image``, and a ``StandardButtonType/role``, as well as an optional ``StandardButtonType/keyboardShortcut``.


## Installation

StandardButtons can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

## Getting started

StandardButtons has ``StandardButtonType``-based  ``SwiftUI/Button``, ``SwiftUI/Label``, and ``SwiftUI/Link`` initializers to let you create standard control views:

```swift
Button(.add)Â { ... }
Label(.add)Â { ... }
Link(.email, destination: .email(...))
```

This will render regular controls that works on all major Apple platforms (iOS, macOS, tvOS, watchOS, visionOS), that applies a proper icon, localized title, role, accessibility traits, etc for the providd button type.

You can use the ``StandardAction`` enum to generate a ``StandardAction/control`` for common actions, like ``StandardAction/call(phoneNumber:)``, ``StandardAction/copy(_:)``, ``StandardAction/email(address:)``, and ``StandardAction/openUrl(_:)``.

```swift
StandardAction.email(address: "daniel@gmail.com")
```

You can also use URL extensions like ``Foundation/URL/call(number:)`` and ``Foundation/URL/email(address:)`` to generate URLs for common actions. These are used by the ``StandardAction`` when generating call and email action controls.
