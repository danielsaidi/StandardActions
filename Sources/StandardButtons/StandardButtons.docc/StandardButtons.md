# ``StandardButtons``

StandardButtons is a SwiftUI library that makes it easy to create standard button types.


## Overview

![Library logotype](Logo.png)

StandardButtons is a SwiftUI library that lets you create standard button types, with localized titles, icons, roles and keyboard shortcuts.

StandardButtons has a ``StandardButtonType`` enum that defines **120** common actions, like ``StandardButtonType/add``, ``StandardButtonType/remove``, ``StandardButtonType/like``, and ``StandardButtonType/subscribe``, as well as a ``StandardToggleType`` enum with common toggle values, and ``StandardAction`` with common actions, etc.

Each ``StandardButtonType`` has a localized ``StandardButtonType/title``, an ``StandardButtonType/image``, a ``StandardButtonType/role``, and an optional ``StandardButtonType/keyboardShortcut``. These properties will automatically be applied when you create type-based buttons, labels, links, and toggles.


## Installation

## Getting started

You can create ``SwiftUI/Button``, ``SwiftUI/Label`` and ``SwiftUI/Link`` views for any ``StandardButtonType``. This automatically applies the localized title, icon, role, shortcut, accessibility, etc. for the provided button type:

```swift
Button(.add)Â { ... }
Label(.add)Â { ... }
Link(.email, destination: .email(...))
```

You can create ``SwiftUI/Toggle`` views for any ``StandardToggleType`` and a boolean binding. This automatically applies the localized title, icon, role, shortcut, accessibility, etc. for the provided toggle type, based on the toggle state:

```swift
Toggle(.isVisible, isOn: $isVisible)
```

You can also use ``StandardAction`` to generate a standard control for common actions, like ``StandardAction/call(phoneNumber:)``, ``StandardAction/copy(_:)``, ``StandardAction/email(address:)``, and ``StandardAction/openUrl(_:)``.

```swift
/// Render a control for the provided action
StandardActionControl(.email(address: "daniel@gmail.com"))

/// Render a list item with the action as a trailing action
StandardActionListItem(
    title: ..., 
    text: ..., 
    action: .email(address: "daniel@gmail.com")
)
```

You can also use URL extensions like ``Foundation/URL/call(number:)`` and ``Foundation/URL/email(address:)`` to generate URLs for common URL-based actions.
