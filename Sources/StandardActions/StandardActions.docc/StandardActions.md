# ``StandardActions``

A SwiftUI library with standard action types.


## Overview

![Library logotype](Logo.png)

StandardActions is a SwiftUI library that defines standard action types with localized titles, icons, button roles, keyboard shortcuts, etc.

StandardActions has a ``StandardActionType`` enum that defines **121** actions, like ``StandardActionType/add``, ``StandardActionType/remove``, etc., a ``StandardToggleType`` enum with common toggle values, and a ``StandardAction`` with common actions, etc.

Each ``StandardActionType`` has a localized ``StandardActionType/title``, an ``StandardActionType/image``, a ``StandardActionType/role``, and an optional ``StandardActionType/keyboardShortcut``. These properties will automatically be applied when you create type-based buttons, labels, links, and toggles.


## Installation

StandardActions can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

## Getting started

You can create a ``SwiftUI/Button``, ``SwiftUI/Label`` and ``SwiftUI/Link`` for any ``StandardActionType``. This will automatically apply a localized title, icon, etc.

```swift
Button(.add)Â { ... }
Label(.add)Â { ... }
Link(.email, destination: .email(...))
```

You can create a ``SwiftUI/Toggle`` for any ``StandardToggleType``. This applies the localized title, icon, etc. for the type, based on the state:

```swift
Toggle(.isVisible, isOn: $isVisible)
```

You can use ``StandardAction`` to generate a standard control for common actions, like ``StandardAction/call(phoneNumber:)``, ``StandardAction/copy(_:)``, etc.

```swift
/// Render a control for the provided action
StandardActionControl(.email(address: "daniel@gmail.com"))

/// Render a list item with the action as a trailing action
StandardActionListItem(
    title: ..., 
    text: ..., 
    action: .email(address: "daniel@gmail.com")
)
```

You can also use URL extensions like ``Foundation/URL/call(number:)`` and ``Foundation/URL/email(address:)`` to generate URLs for common URL-based actions.
